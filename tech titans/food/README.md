# FoodShare - Food Donation Platform

## Overview

FoodShare is a web platform that connects food donors with people in need through a network of restaurant partners. The platform allows users to donate food or money, which is then used to provide meals to those experiencing food insecurity. Restaurants can also sign up as partners to help prepare and distribute meals or donate excess food that would otherwise go to waste.

## Features

- **Food Donation**: Users can donate food for a specific number of people
- **Money Donation**: Users can make monetary contributions to support the cause
- **Restaurant Partnership**: Restaurants can sign up to become partners in food preparation and distribution
- **Location-Based Matching**: The platform connects donors with the nearest restaurant partners
- **Excess Food Utilization**: Restaurants can donate excess food that would otherwise be wasted
