# WasteLess – Community Recycling & Reuse Hub

## Overview

WasteLess is a web platform that connects people in local communities to share and repurpose leftover materials such as cardboard, clothing, electronics, and other items that might otherwise end up in landfills. The platform supports a circular economy by enabling users to post items they no longer need and find items they can reuse or repurpose.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Item Sharing**: Users can post leftover materials with descriptions, photos, and pickup details
- **Browse & Search**: Find available items by category, location, or keyword search
- **Dual View Options**: Grid view for browsing multiple items or map view to see items by location
- **User Profiles**: Create accounts to track contributions and build community reputation
- **Request System**: Simple process to request items from other community members

### Key Components

- **Category System**: Organized browsing by material type (Electronics, Textiles, Packaging, etc.)
- **Location-Based Matching**: Find items near you with distance filtering
- **Points System**: Gamification to encourage active participation and sharing
- **Community Impact Tracking**: Visual statistics showing waste diverted from landfills

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Map Integration**: Mapbox GL JS for location-based features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for all device sizes
- **Icons**: Font Awesome for visual elements

## Setup Instructions

## Future Enhancements

- **Community Events**: Organization of local swap meets and recycling events

## How It Works

1. **Post Items**: Users photograph and describe materials they want to share
2. **Browse & Discover**: Community members browse available items by category or location
3. **Request & Connect**: Interested users request items and arrange pickup/delivery
4. **Track Impact**: Platform calculates and displays community environmental impact
